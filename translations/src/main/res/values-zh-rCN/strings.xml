    <string name="day_phase_golden_hour_description">
        In photography, the golden hour (sometimes known as magic hour, especially in cinematography) is a period shortly after sunrise or before sunset during which daylight is redder and softer compared to when the Sun is higher in the sky.\nThe term \"hour\" is used figuratively; the effect has no clearly defined duration and varies according to season and latitude.
    </string>
    <string name="day_phase_blue_hour_description">
        The blue hour is the period of twilight each morning and evening when the sun is a significant distance below the horizon and the residual, indirect sunlight takes on a predominantly blue hue.\nDuring the blue \"hour\", red light passes straight into space while blue light is scattered in the atmosphere and therefore reaches the earth\'s surface.\nBecause of the quality of the light, this period is treasured by artists.
    </string>
    <string name="day_phase_twilight_civil_description">
        Morning civil twilight begins when the geometric center of the sun is 6° below the horizon (civil dawn) and ends at sunrise.\nEvening civil twilight begins at sunset and ends when the geometric center of the sun reaches 6° below the horizon (civil dusk).\nCivil twilight can also be described as the limit at which twilight illumination is sufficient, under clear weather conditions, for terrestrial objects to be clearly distinguished.
    </string>
    <string name="day_phase_twilight_nautical_description">
        During nautical twilight, the horizon is clearly visible, but artificial lighting must be used to see terrestrial objects clearly.\nMorning nautical twilight is defined to begin when the center of the sun is geometrically 12 degrees below the horizon and to end at sunrise.\nEvening nautical twilight is defined to begin at sunset and end when the center of the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon.\nIn general, nautical twilight ends when navigation via the horizon at sea is no longer possible.
    </string>
    <string name="day_phase_twilight_astronomical_description">
        Morning astronomical twilight is defined to begin when the center of the sun is geometrically 18 degrees below the horizon and to end at sunrise.\nEvening astronomical twilight is defined to begin at sunset and end when the center of the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon.\nFrom the end of astronomical twilight in the evening to the beginning of astronomical twilight in the morning, the sky (away from urban light pollution) is dark enough for all astronomical observations.

    <string name="beta_program_description">If you want to test experimental features of the app before they’re released, you can join the beta tester program.\n
        As a beta tester, you\’ll be able to use features that haven’t been released to the public. These features could become available to the public in the future. We ask that you don’t publicize or share the features you’re testing until they’re publicly launched.\n
        By beta testing, you’ll become an important part of the app’s development. Your participation and feedback will help us release a better version of the app.\n
        Please note that testing versions may be unstable or have a few bugs.</string>
